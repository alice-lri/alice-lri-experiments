# Results Folder README

This folder contains the results and databases generated and used during the experiments. Below is an explanation of the contents and how to obtain or generate the required files.

## db/

Inside the `db/` subfolder, you should have two SQLite database files:

### 1. `initial.sqlite`

- **Purpose:**
  - This is the initial database containing references to all datasets (KITTI and DURLAR), their frames, paths, and other basic data. It serves as the input for running experiments on the HPC cluster.
- **How to obtain:**
  - **Option 1: Generate it locally**
    - Use the script [`scripts/local/db/create_initial_db.sh`](../scripts/local/db/create_initial_db.sh). **Note:** This requires that you have already downloaded the entire KITTI and DURLAR datasets, as the script will scan these files to populate the database.
    - After generating `initial.sqlite` locally, you must copy it to the HPC cluster at the path specified by the `BASE_DB_DIR` environment variable (see `../.env`). For example:
      ```bash
      scp results/db/initial.sqlite <your_hpc_user>@<hpc_address>:${BASE_DB_DIR}/initial.sqlite
      ```
  - **Option 2: Download the pre-built database**
    - Download from: [https://nextcloud.citius.gal/s/alice_lri_initial_db](https://nextcloud.citius.gal/s/alice_lri_initial_db)
    - Then copy it to the HPC as described above.

### 2. `master.sqlite`

- **Purpose:**
  - This is the final database, created after executing all experiments on the HPC. It contains everything from `initial.sqlite` plus all experiment results. This database is then used by scripts to generate tables and figures for the paper, which are exported to the `paper/` folder.
- **How to obtain:**
  - **Option 1: Generate it on the HPC**
    - Execute all experiments as explained in the root `README.md`. This will populate the `master.sqlite` file with results in the `BASE_DB_DIR` on the HPC.
    - After experiments are complete, copy the resulting `master.sqlite` from the HPC back to your local `results/db/` folder for further analysis and use with local scripts. For example:
      ```bash
      scp <your_hpc_user>@<hpc_address>:${BASE_DB_DIR}/master.sqlite results/db/master.sqlite
      ```
  - **Option 2: Download the pre-built database**
    - Download from: [https://nextcloud.citius.gal/s/alice_lri_master_db](https://nextcloud.citius.gal/s/alice_lri_master_db)

## csv/

The `csv/` subfolder contains two CSV files used for runtime analysis:

- **alice_times.csv**: Used by the `scripts/local/paper/helper/generate_alice_times_table.py` script to generate the runtime analysis table for ALICE-LRI as reported in the paper.
- **rtst_times.csv**: Used by the `scripts/local/paper/helper/generate_rtst_times_table.py` script to generate the runtime performance comparison of the original vs. modified RTST compression algorithm, as reported in the paper.

Currently, these files contain the exact times reported in the paper. If you remove or rename these files, the corresponding scripts will prompt you to recompute the times, and the files will be regenerated on your machine.

## paper/

The `paper/` subfolder contains data and figures generated from the experiment results. These are used to produce the tables and figures included in the paper. The contents can be generated by directly invoking the main paper metrics generation script: `scripts/local/paper/generate_paper_metrics.sh`.
