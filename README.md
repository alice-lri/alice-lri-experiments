# ALICE-LRI Experiments

This repository contains all the code, scripts, and configuration required to reproduce the experiments for the ALICE-LRI paper. It is designed to provide a fully reproducible workflow, from data preparation to results and paper figures.

## Reproducibility Guide

The complete step-by-step process to reproduce all experiments and results is described in detail in [REPRODUCIBILITY.md](./REPRODUCIBILITY.md).

## Repository Structure

- **alice-lri/**: Submodule containing the ALICE-LRI library (core algorithm, C++/Python bindings).
- **rtst-modified/**: Fork of the original RTST compression algorithm, including both the original and modified versions for evaluation.
- **container/**: Container definition and environment files for reproducible builds (Apptainer/Singularity).
- **results/**: Databases, CSVs, and generated figures/tables from experiments.
- **scripts/**: Automation scripts for data preparation, experiment execution, and analysis.
- **.env**: Environment configuration file. This file defines important paths and variables for both local and HPC environments.
